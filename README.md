## This is my security tester companion. It's a collection of multiple types of lists used during my security assessments, collected in one place. 

## List types include sensitive data patterns, fuzzing payloads, and web shells.
## The goal is to enable a security tester to pull this repository onto a new testing box and have access to every type of list that may be needed.
